# Credit Card Consumption Prediction
This project develops a machine learning model to predict future credit card spending based on customer demographics and historical transaction behavior.

### ðŸ“ˆ Business Context and Objective
In the data-rich credit card industry, understanding customer behavior is key to developing effective marketing strategies and improving customer relationships. By analyzing spending patterns, banks can tailor their services and promotions, ultimately boosting sales and revenue. A deep understanding of consumption patterns at an individual level allows banks to customize offerings and make strategic marketing plans.

The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model for a leading bank. This model will forecast the average credit card spend for a set of customers over the next three months (July, August, September) based on their past behavior (April, May, June) and demographic characteristics.
